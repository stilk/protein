## Expression ##
TCGA: RNA-seq data was downloaded from XENA database of un-normalized raw expression data ##
CCLE: RNA-seq data was downloaded from DepMap (oct 4 2021) Version 21Q3


## Drug ##
CCLE: Drug was downloaded from DepMap (oct 4 2021) version 19Q4

## Genetic Dependency ##
CCLE: RNAi knockdown Demeter V6 was downloaded, which combines 3 datasets (Achilles + DRIVE + Marcotte + DEMETER2).
    Cancer cell line genetic dependencies estimated using the DEMETER2 model. 
    DEMETER2 is applied to three large-scale RNAi screening datasets: the Broad Institute Project Achilles,
    Novartis Project DRIVE, and the Marcotte et al. breast cell line dataset. 

## Mutations ##
CCLE: Mutation calls were downloaded from DepMap (Oct 4 2021) Version 21Q3

## Clinical ##
    MMRF-Commpass RNA-seq and Exome sequencing data was collected from the GDC on 10/14/2021
